# Havn-themes
A collections of themes in the Havn colourway.

## Apps currently supported:
* [Mona](https://mastodon.social/@MonaApp)
* [Noteplan](https://noteplan.co)

## Naming
The themes are named after my blog, [havn.blog](https://havn.blog/en/). _Havn_ means _harbour_ in Norwegian, and is named as it's supposed to be a safe haven for (too many) thoughs I always carry with me.

The light version is called _Daggry_, which means _dawn_,
and the dark version is called _Skumring_, which means _dusk_.

So, that gives us:
Light version: **Havn Daggry**
Dark version: **Havn Skumring**

## Typefaces
I like to use [Neue Montreal](https://pangrampangram.com/products/neue-montreal) (and it's [mono sibling](https://pangrampangram.com/products/neue-montreal-mono)) from [Pangram Pangram](https://pangrampangram.com/). And they have a generous selection, for personal use, even without buying the entire familiy. A great app for installing apps on your iOS devices, is [Fontcase](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1205074470?ls=1&mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4G7&ct=APPS) by [The Iconfactory](https://iconfactory.com/)https://iconfactory.com/.

But the themes ofc. works with standard fonts as well! Apple is a bit stingy with it's fonts out-of-the-box for some reason, so it could actually be a good idea to install [these files](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lcna9x23al8z6hq/AAAtvz5qHzCH3XXEt45J8Ntga?dl=0) with Fontcase to get some more options in San Francisco and New York.

## Colours
The idea behind the colours, is to have a maritime feel with a couple of accents. The main colours are all shades of the same blue (same _hue_ and _saturation_, with just differing _lightness_) - the backgrounds are very light (or very dark) blue, and the text is the opposite. The higher in the hierarcy a header is, the more contrast the text has.

Here's the main text colours. _Daggry_ left, _Skumring_ right (in parentheses):
   backgroundColour: #fcfcfd (#1a1e30)
