# Links for the Mona themes:

I don't know if you really have to use the different links for the different platforms. But this is the links I get when sharing from the specific platforms! Try adding one, and see it if propagates to the others. If not, use the other links here.

I can't get GitHub to make the mona-cat links clickableâ€¦ But you can try to copy it into your browser, or using it when importing in Mona. I've also used a "link shortener" (which in this case makes them much longer) to create something clickable.
